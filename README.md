# ExoCNN
An AI-powered suite for exoplanet detection and analysis

https://exohunters.streamlit.app/

FITS Viewer:

          > Used to view and analyse the Lightcurve FITS
          > It can support Multi header FITS Files also
          > We can Plot and Save the resuls from the Lightcurve FITS Files
          > https://exohunters.streamlit.app/FITS_Viewer
          
LightCurve Analysis:

          > In this page we can Upload Lightcurve and predict the Exoplanets
          > Using Our AI model we are predicting the Exoplanet and Giving Output Verdict and Probability of that verdict
          > Admin & Model management Window password : 2030
          > In the Admin & Model management Window we can Manually Replace Other AI Model and Get predictions from them(.pt Extension is preferred)
          > We can Reset the model To their Original model Config in the Reset Tab
          > https://exohunters.streamlit.app/Light_Curve_Analysis
          
Tabular Model Analysis:

          > We can use this page to Upload Either CSV files or We can manually input each parameters to get the predictions
          > In batch analysis we can Upload Multiple csv files for predictions
          > Admin & Model management Window password : 2030
          > in the Admin & Model management Window We can replace the Default model with other AI model(.pkl Extension is preferred)
          > We can retrain the model using Labeled data in this window
          > We can reset to Default Model config Anytime we want
          
Model Metrics:

          > In this Page we can see the Model metrics and Parameters of the Exocnn Model
          > With that Metrics we can Understand the model easily

Used Astroquery,MAST,Exofop for Lightcurve FITS Files           
Used NASA KOI,K2 and TESS datasets and Lightcurve FITS Files for training
